This is fine-grained modelself.nn_config['normal_senti_prototype_num']*3+self.nn_config['attribute_senti_prototype_num']*self.nn_config['attributes_num']

be careful attribute matrix, it should not be generated for each sentence.

Requirements:
attribute dim = sentence word dim
sentiment dim = word dim or h dim
sentiment dim = lstm_cell_size
to make life easy, lstm_cell_size = word dim

If switch to the lstm version, the place use wordembedding should be changed to lstm

In this model, the attribute and its sentiment are detected at the same time.
