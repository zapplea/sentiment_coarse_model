Changes of attribute data generator:
1. To use this new feature, need to add a new function at attribute data generator: smartInitiater().
This function should provide word embedding of aspects and attributes. Some attribute like STYLE_OPTIONS has two words, we split them
into two words and get the mean of their word embeddings.
eg.Assume all attributes: [aspect1#attribute1, aspect1#attribute2, aspect2#attribute3]
the returned matrix should be:
[[aspect1 wordEmbedding, attribute1 wordEmbedding],
 [aspect1 wordEmbedding, attribute2 wordEmbedding],
 [aspect2 wrodEmbedding, attribute3 wordEmbedding]]

Another thing need to be careful is that the identifier of attribute in returned matrix should be the same to Y_att.
eg. In the above: {aspect1#attribute1 : 0, aspect1#attribute2 : 1, aspect2#attribute3 : 2}
Then for the returned matrix,
matrix[0] = [aspect1 wordEmbedding, attribute1 wordEmbedding]
matrix[1] = [aspect1 wordEmbedding, attribute2 wordEmbedding]
matrix[2] = [aspect2 wrodEmbedding, attribute3 wordEmbedding]
