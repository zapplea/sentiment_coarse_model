dependency_generator.py:
the unknow words is represented by '#UNK#'.

At first the sentence contains 'ROOT', then in sentence_encoder we delete it.

Need to add 'dependency_parsing_filePath' to data_config

The table of relative distance is arranged based on index of words in the original sentence.

Observation1:
dependency parser will remove punctuations, but the result of tokenizer will not do that. so use dependency parser as tokenizer to process data.
