dependency_generator.py:
the unknow words is represented by '#UNK#'.

At first the sentence contains 'ROOT', then in sentence_encoder we delete it.

Need to add 'dependency_parsing_filePath' to data_config

The table of relative distance is arranged based on index of words in the original sentence.

Observation1:
dependency parser will remove punctuations, but the result of tokenizer will not do that. so use dependency parser as tokenizer to process data.

The dependency parser will generate training data for sentiment function, both relative distance and dependency path.

special situation:
1. sentiment word and attribute word are the same word.
2. sentiment word is in the path to attribute word

check:
if the direction of the path is correct after conjunction.
